The survey ran between `r range(dat$StartDate |> lubridate::as_date()) |> lubridate::parse_date_time("y m d")`. `r nrow(dat)` people answered the survey, of which `r dat |> filter(Q4 == "Yes") |> nrow()` gave us consent to use the results internally at SRC. All results below include only the individuals who gave us their permission.
